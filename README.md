# <p align="center"># Loops In Action 🚀</p>


Welcome to the **Loops In Action** repository! 🎉 This repository contains a collection of loop pattern solutions implemented in various programming languages, focusing on star patterns, number patterns, and alphabet patterns.

## Overview 📝
In this repository, you'll find a series of loop pattern problems solved in different programming languages. These patterns include:
1. **Star Patterns** ⭐: Visual patterns created using asterisks (`*`).
2. **Number Patterns** 🔢: Patterns using numbers arranged in a specific format.
3. **Alphabet Patterns** 🔤: Patterns formed with alphabets.

Each pattern demonstrates the power of loops and is intended to help programmers practice and improve their problem-solving skills. 💻

## Pattern Categories 📂

### 1. Star Patterns ⭐
The star patterns section contains various shapes and figures made entirely of stars (`*`). These patterns include triangles, pyramids, diamonds, and more.

### 2. Number Patterns 🔢
In this category, you will find patterns using numbers in ascending or descending order, often arranged in matrices or pyramids.

### 3. Alphabet Patterns 🔤
Alphabet patterns demonstrate how loops can be used to create letters or sequences of alphabets in different orientations.

## Language Used 💻
- C++ 💡

## Contributing 🤝
Contributions are welcome! If you have a new pattern or improvement, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
